 Set over 2 blocks, both of 44 storeys, Queens Park has 736 well designed units with functional, smart layouts. Units start on the 8th floor and go all the way to the 44th, where the 4 large penthouse suites are located. Queens Park boasts several features that are unusual for a development in this price range, including private lifts and foyers for many of the units, not just the penthouses. Location-wise, Queens Park couldn’t be more convenient for the MRT, as it overlooks the Queenstown Station, and a bridge is being planned to connect the station to the development.

 An ultra-spacious 1-bedder with modern open kitchen and a good-sized balcony to enjoy the splendid view from, this property is perfect for the well-heeled executive who won't be contented with the ordinary.
 
 With this size, you get a spacious living area that can fit up to a four-seater sofa, a proper dining room that can comfortably sit six, and a bedroom that can fit even an American King-sized bed.
 
 The unit comes with a long bath which is rare in one-bedroom units in Singapore. Soak in your bath with a glass of wine after a long day at work, and you can enjoy the spectacular night view from the bath too!

 Enjoy meals at eateries boasting all kinds of international cuisines right at your doorstep across the road in conservation site Kampong Glam, and be served by a 24/7 convenience store right in the condo itself.

1- and 2-bedroom Duplex Units for Lease at Pasir Panjang
 Bijou, a freehold development where sophisticated living transcends into an expression of one's individuality. Experience downtown’s dynamism along the fringes of Singapore’s CBD. This Far East SOHO development perfectly balances urban appeal with classical garden landscapes encircling a rooftop pool and gym.
 
 During National Day Rally 2019, the Singapore Government highlighted on the future transformation plans for Greater Southern Waterfront as part of nation building.
 
 Stretching across 2,000 hectares of land from Pasir Panjang to Gardens by the Bay East, this redevelopment would include a business district, 30-km long scenic waterfront promenade, a green corridor linking Labrador Park to Gardens by the Bay and the development of Pulau Brani into a new tourism attraction – reshaping Greater Southern Waterfront as a new ‘live, work and play’ precinct.
 
 Strategically situated in a tranquil spot directly opposite Pasir Panjang MRT Station, Bijou is in close proximity to key business hubs, retail and recreational venues. Come 2025, Bijou will enjoy added connectivity to the CBD with the completion of the Circle Line loop.
 
 Thrive alongside a diverse and enterprising community of 120 low-rise units; the freehold development is integrated with artisanal retail and F&B options brimming with untapped opportunity.

 This lovely development brings about many simple pleasures of life. Residents get to enjoy the infinity- like pool as a form of leisure or to even perfect the art and skill of the sport. Besides that, there are various plants and trees surrounding the premise, almost appearing to serve as a ‘green hedge of barrier’ against the hustle and bustle of the surrounding townships and city centers nearby. The lush greenery provides a feel of a garden themed residency. It is therapeutic to the nature lover and brings a sense of comfort and peace to all who live in the residence. Besides that, there is a designated barbecue area available for residents who intend to have company over for fellowship and it is also a great way to strengthen bonds besides sharpening certain culinary skills. Apart from that, residents that have been found living in smaller communities tend to cultivate a sense of belonging through the interactions/experiences with other residents. As a result of that, many have been recorded to forge and strengthen friendships over the years. The circumstantial series of events have indirectly opened doors to a new cluster of close- knit communities. Residents have also been cited saying that they also have some form of assurance of security and also a sense of place after settling down in/with small groups of people.

 Sturdee Residences – Unique Selling Points
 
 The location of Sturdee Residences, both in terms of the number of amenities within walking or easy driving distance and its proximity to an MRT line (shortly 2 MRT lines) is by far the biggest plus point in its favour. Several shopping malls, Little India, and a huge array of wining and dining options just a few minutes’ walk from the development are something that projects going for a lot more money cannot match. Facility and looks wise, Sturdee Residences is also has a lot to commend it.
 
 Sturdee Residences – Accessibility
 
 The nearest MRT station to Sturdee Residences is Farrer Park on the North East Line, which is an easy 5 minute walk away. 
 
 Raffles Place is just 9 minutes away for those commuting to the CBD, while City Hall is just 2 stops. Orchard Road is only a little further down the line. 
 
 The forthcoming Bendemeer MRT Station, on the Downtown Line, will be even closer to the development and will offer residents extra options, as well as easing congestion on the existing line.
 
 For those wishing to drive, Sturdee Residences is approximately a 6 minute drive from the CBD, via the CTE, assuming traffic isn’t heavy. There is also a bus stop close to the development, with routes serving many areas of the island.

 River Place is a river-side modern condominium located along the banks of Singapore River at Havelock Road and Clemenceau Avenue. It is walking distance to Clark Quay MRT station and two bus stops away from the Raffles MRT station.
 
 Its upscale finishes, resort ambience and brand new condition has lead to a high take up rate by young romantic couples and those working at Raffles Place.
 
 River Place has a great location just outside the Central Business District (CBD), which is within walking distance to the nightlife of Mohamed Sultan, Riverside Point, Clark Quay and Boat Quay.
 
 This is a place where you can stroll along a tree-lined river side promenade, cross the footbridge or even walk to your office and nearby shops and shopping malls in Chinatown.

 Queens Peak - Project information
 
 Set over 2 blocks, both of 44 storeys, Queens Park has 736 well designed units with functional, smart layouts. Units start on the 8th floor and go all the way to the 44th, where the 4 large penthouse suites are located. Queens Park boasts several features that are unusual for a development in this price range, including private lifts and foyers for many of the units, not just the penthouses. Location-wise, Queens Park couldn’t be more convenient for the MRT, as it overlooks the Queenstown Station, and a bridge is being planned to connect the station to the development.

 Queens Peak - Project information
 
 Set over 2 blocks, both of 44 storeys, Queens Park has 736 well designed units with functional, smart layouts. Units start on the 8th floor and go all the way to the 44th, where the 4 large penthouse suites are located. Queens Park boasts several features that are unusual for a development in this price range, including private lifts and foyers for many of the units, not just the penthouses. Location-wise, Queens Park couldn’t be more convenient for the MRT, as it overlooks the Queenstown Station, and a bridge is being planned to connect the station to the development.

 Commonwealth Towers
 
 This two towered development benefits from very close proximity to Queenstown MRT Station, on the East West Line, meaning resident of Commonwealth Towers can be in Orchard Road, the CBD or Marina Bay in less than a quarter of an hour and it’s within District 3. Well-designed modern apartment units are a feature of this project from one of the most highly regarded developers in Singapore. The vast majority of the units in Commonwealth Towers are one or two bedrooms, with many of the one bedroom flats having just 441 sqft, making it affordable despite its proximity to the MRT.Commonwealth Towers is developed and built by City Developments Limited (CDL) a Singapore-listed international property and hospitality conglomerate, and one of the biggest landlords on the island. Its extensive global network encompasses more than 400 subsidiaries and associated companies, and owns and manages properties across Asia, Europe the Middle East, North America and New Zealand/Australia. Established in 1963, CDL has won numerous awards both here in Singapore as well as internationally, and has earned itself a reputation for being a socially responsible corporation, championing green and environmentally aware initiatives and projects.
 
 Commonwealth Towers – Unique Selling Points
 
 The number of one and two bedroom units, as well as the relatively small size of them is something that differentiates Commonwealth Towers. The other thing of course is its closeness to the MRT station. Being over the road from a station on the East West Line, is rare, especially this close in to the centre, especially for a new build. The importance that has on the saleability of Commonwealth Towers cannot be overstated.

Beautiful Loft unit for Rent
 The Seawind’s location is excellent. The neighbourhood is mainly populated with private bungalows and recently high class condos. Despite its peaceful and laid back vibe, it is also very close to the many amenities that makes this area so popular – a combination that is difficult to beat or even match. The Seawind is about 100m to East Coast Road with easy access to e.g. Siglap Centre.

 Queens Peak – Accessibility
 
 Queens Park actually overlooks Queenstown MRT station, and there are plans to connect the two with a covered bridge. The station is on the East West Line, 4 and 5 stops from Tanjong Pagar and Raffles Place respectively, meaning residents of Queens Park can be in the CBD within 20 minutes of leaving their homes. Several buses serve the area, with the nearest shopping mall – Dawson Place which has eateries, ATM’s and a NTUC Fairprice, 3 stops away (or a 10 minute walk).

 North Park Residences
 
 The location is by far and away the biggest draw for North Park Residences, being built as it is on top of Northpoint City – the largest mall in the north of the island. It boasts more than 400 retail and dining options, with Northpoint Link an underground walkway connecting North Park Residences to the Yishun MRT Station home to a further 30. There is also a bus interchange, library, cinema, community club and town plaza on site. North Park Residences itself features 88 facilities of its own, as well as a wide range of unit types.
 
 North Park Residences couldn’t be more conveniently located in terms of transport, retail and indeed dining options, sitting as it does on top of the largest shopping mall in the north of the island. It will be connected to Yishun MRT Station on the North South Line via Northpoint Link, an underground walkway that itself will be home to 30 retail outlets. From there Orchard Road is 9 stops, with the CBD a further 3 away, meaning commuters can comfortably be door to door in under half an hour. North Park Residences is next to the SLE, which leads onto the CTE meaning drivers can be in the CBD in 20 minutes.

 The fact that The Boutique is so close to the MRT – it is a 7 minute walk from Somerset MRT Station – it is a huge plus point for this development and will be the reason most people buy. It is also situated quite near to several other MRT Stations such as Fort Canning MRT and Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station which are only 1 km away from The Boutique and gives access to the residents of The Boutique to many different areas of Singapore. Due to availability of too many amenities on the doorstep, The Boutique is an ideal place to live and there will be many other changes as gentrification tales hold of the area in the future, and the impact is lessened to a large extent by the MRT.

 Tre Residences – Accessibility
 Tre Residence could hardly be better positioned in terms of the MRT, as it is right next door to Aljunied Station, and connected to it via a covered walkway. Aljunied is on the East West Line just 5 stops from Raffles Place. 1 stop either side of Aljunied is Kallang Interchange and Paya Lebar, where you can get onto the Circle Line. The PIE is approximat
 Tre Residences is a residential development located in Geylang, District 14. Though it is very competitively priced, it has the look, appearance and feel of a luxury condominium, with its attention to detail, its penthouse units with direct access to the sky patio, and its themed sky terraces.

 At a staggering 250 metres, Altez brings a new perspective to the term “high-life”. The 62-storey development offers panoramic views of the sea and the city, and full condominium facilities. Just two minutes’ walk from Tanjong Pagar MRT Station, residents enjoy excellent access to the Central Business District and the Marina Coastal Expressway (MCE).
 URA Draft Master Plan 2019 highlighted the Downtown transformation plan and The Greater Southern Waterfront development plan. Strategically located at downtown Tanjong Pagar, Altez is well-positioned to benefit from the enlivening enhancements of both zones.
 The Downtown transformation plan focuses on the various needs of modern lifestyles, increasing conveniences and connectivity to create a vibrant place for the modern working professional to live and work in. 
 The Greater Southern Waterfront development plan spans across 2,000 hectares from Gardens by the Bay East to Pasir Panjang. It promises an attractive waterfront promenade where various places of interests, like the historic Tanjong Pagar Railway, would be connected. 
 The development is also directly linked to Icon Village, a destination mall designed to create a cosmopolitan lifestyle, and a short walk away from 100 AM retail mall.

 Alexandra is located within the town of Bukit Merah, along the eastern border of the Queenstown district. It is the site of the historic Alexandra Hospital and was also where IKEA opened its first mega store in Singapore.
 
 It is a quiet and convenient residential with plenty of schools and amenities within reach, making it great for raising families.
 
 With the opening of the Thomson-East Coast MRT line (TEL) and Greater Southern Waterfront expansion, Alexandra residents can look forward to better connectivity and investments in the area.

 Set over 2 blocks, both of 44 stories, Queens Park has 736 well-designed units with functional, smart layouts. Units start on the 8th floor and go all the way to the 44th, where the 4 large penthouse suites are located. Queens Park boasts several features that are unusual for development in this price range, including private lifts and foyers for many of the units, not just the penthouses. Location-wise, Queens Park couldn’t be more convenient for the MRT, as it overlooks the Queenstown Station, and a bridge is being planned to connect the station to the development.

One bdfrok
 This mixed development site in the much sought after Marina Bay area, features 1,042 high end luxury residential units as well as several internationally renowned retail and dining outlets. What makes Marina One Residences stand out however, is its very own biodiversity garden – The Green Heart, which gives the whole development a feeling of calm and tranquility despite being located right in the centre of one of the busiest cities in the world. Marina One Residences is also connected to 4 MRT lines, while 4 nearby expressways give access to all parts of the island. Marina One Residences is owned and developed by M + S Pte Ltd, a historic collaboration between Malaysia’s Khazanah Nasional Berhad and Singapore’s Temasek that was set up in 2011 to build Marina One Residences and Duo.

 Gem Residences – Unique Selling Points
 
 While the location may be uninspiring, Gem Residences in itself is a unique development, and one that makes light of its immediate surroundings. Somewhere in the grey area between a hotel and a condominium, Gem Residences offers an array of features and services that would be impressive in an extremely high end development. These include the ability for residents to order from food menus from their concierge that are then delivered to their homes. The concierge also offers a service for grocery shopping. Gem Residences also provides housekeeping, pet pools and fitness classes. Fully trained medical staff are also on site.
 
 Gem Residences – Accessibility
 
 Gem Residences is close to a wide variety of local eateries, and there are also places for grocery shopping. The concierge services available onsite however may well make those choices redundant. With regards to the MRT, Gem Residences is not quite as convenient, located where it is in between Braddell and Toa Payoh stations. Neither are particularly close, Braddell is slightly nearer to the development but it is still a 15 to 20 minute walk. Once on the train things improve. They are both on the North South Line, with Newton two stops away, and Orchard and City hall a few further on.

 Toa Payoh, literally means ""big swamp"" in Hokkien dialect, which references the large swampy area that the town used to be. As one of the oldest residential estates and its central location in Singapore, Toa Payoh is a vibrant town bustling with activities. The Toa Payoh New Town was built in 1968 as HDB's second satellite town in regards to urban planning principles of the time.
 
 The self-contained housing estate has a town centre acting as a focal point of the retail and entertainment at the convenience of the residents. Since 2002, HDB's headquarters have relocated to HDB Hub located in Toa Payoh Central. With a total of 12 subzones, Toa Payoh is home to approximately 109,000 HDB residents and 36,616 flats.

Modern 1 Bedder Condo For Rent
 ***Renovated 1 Bedder For Rent***
 
 - 1Br1B, 484sqf
 - High floor
 - Corner unit
 - Bright and well maintained
 - Unblocked view
 - 10 mins drive to city
 
 Principal Garden is located at Prince Charles Crescent in District 3, and has a total of 663 units.
 
 Principal Garden is strategically situated in a mature and tranquil neighborhood which is well-connected to the public transportation at the same time. Surrounded by Good Class bungalows, this private estate is truly an exclusive habitat for families and singles alike.
 
 - Developed by prominent developer – UOL
 
 - Within 10 minutes’ drive to Orchard Road, CBD, Marina Bay and Southern Waterfront City.
 
 - Potential tenants and buyers from One-North, Mapletree Business Park, NUS, NUH and business centres in Tiong Bahru.
 
 estled in a quiet enclave along the recreational waterway of Alexandra Canal, on the fringe of the embassy district, Principal Garden reflects a new daring in residential design thinking that purposefully seeks to maximise unbuilt space amid the density of urban Singapore.
 Discover the rare luxury of a home where an overwhelming abundance of outdoor space immerses you in the pleasures of garden living. And where the sense of space is multiplied by uninhibited views that stretch from the low-rise surroundings all the way to the CBD and Orchard Road.
 
 Comprising four 24-storey towers, home to 663 one- to five-bedroom apartments, Principal Garden is delightfully private yet incredibly well connected.

 Queens Peak – Unique Selling Points
 
 Accessibility is a big draw for Queens Park, with its close proximity to Queenstown MRT Station on the East West Line. Three stops takes you to Outram Park on the North East Line, while raffles Place is another two stops along on the East West. With regards to the project itself, Queens P ark has 736 units that range from 425 sqft one bedroom flats up to 4 and 5 bedroom units, as well as 4 extremely large penthouses, measuring an impressive 4,778 sqft. All are functionally yet stylishly designed and laid out, with many having their own private lifts and foyers, something almost unheard of for non-luxury developments
 
 Queens Peak – Accessibility
 
 Queens Park actually overlooks Queenstown MRT station, and there are plans to connect the two with a covered bridge. The station is on the East West Line, 4 and 5 stops from Tanjong Pagar and Raffles Place respectively, meaning residents of Queens Park can be in the CBD within 20 minutes of leaving their homes. Several buses serve the area, with the nearest shopping mall – Dawson Place which has eateries, ATM’s and a NTUC Fairprice, 3 stops away (or a 10 minute walk).

City Square Residence
 City Square Residences is a freehold development located at 2-14 Kitchener Link, near Serangoon Road, in District 08. Completed in 2009 and scaling 30 storeys, this 910-unit development has picture-perfect views of the city. 
 
 City Square Residences offers a myriad of facilities, which includes a swimming pool, lap pool, covered car park, 24 hours security, BBQ pits, gym, fitness station, tennis courts, putting green, steam bath, Jacuzzi, clubhouse, function room, games room, karaoke room, a playground and even a bowling alley. 
 
 Located in prime District 08, many amenities surround City Square. Several bus services are available in the vicinity and it is a short walk from Farrer Park MRT station. Schools and restaurants are located nearby. 
 
 Shopping centres nearby include Mustafa Centre and the upcoming City Square Mall. Attractions such as Little India and The Istana are a stone’s throw away and Raffles Hospital is within reasonable driving distance. 
 
 For vehicle owners, travelling to the CBD and the vibrant Orchard Road shopping belt takes a mere 10 minutes, via Victoria Street and Scotts Road respectively. 
 
 City Square Residences is situated in an excellent location a short stroll away from Farrer Park station, and getting by car to the Central Business District is a swift journey by the Central Expressway. Choice schools nearby are easily accessible, the popular 24-hour Mustafa is a short walk away, and when construction is completed a grand hypermarket would be right next door to City Square residents. In addition, the number of other shops, stores, and food centres nearby ensure variety and the opportunity to try something new everyday is possible.

 Gem Residences
 
 Gem Residences is a residential development in District 12’s Toa Payoh. It is a 15 to 20 minutes’ walk to its nearest MRT station – Braddell on the North South Line, though the development is surrounded by a number of eateries. A number of arterial roads in the vicinity mean getting away by car is a fairly easy task. Gem Residences 578 units are made up of a good split of different configurations, and include dual key and triple key options. By far the biggest thing going for Gem Residences however is the hotel type concept that it has. The concierge will arrange food orders from a provided menu – delivered to your door, the same service is also available for groceries. Fully trained medical staff are on site, and the development also provides such activities as fitness classes while there is a pet pool for dogs.Gem Residences is the first residential development by Venture capitalists Evia Capital Partners Pte Ltd. founded in 2004.
 
 Gem Residences – Unique Selling Points
 
 While the location may be uninspiring, Gem Residences in itself is a unique development, and one that makes light of its immediate surroundings. Somewhere in the grey area between a hotel and a condominium, Gem Residences offers an array of features and services that would be impressive in an extremely high end development. These include the ability for residents to order from food menus from their concierge that are then delivered to their homes. The concierge also offers a service for grocery shopping. Gem Residences also provides housekeeping, pet pools and fitness classes. Fully trained medical staff are also on site.
